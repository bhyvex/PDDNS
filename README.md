A dynamic DNS client supporting multiple service providers

Supported Providers
===================

Currently PDDNS supports <a href="http://dtdns.com">DtDNS</a>, <a href="http://dyn.com">Dyn</a>, <a href="http://noip.com">NoIP</a>, and <a href="http://pointhq.com">Point</a>.  I'm always open to supporting more, these just happened to be the ones I've used in the past and so had accounts ready to test with.
